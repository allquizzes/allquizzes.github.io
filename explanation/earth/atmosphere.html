<h1><br>Explanation: Atmosphere Quiz<br><br></h1>
<details><summary>What percent of our atmosphere is nitrogen ?</summary>
<b>Ans- 78%</b><br>78% of our Atmosphere is Nitrogen , 21% is Oxygen and 1% are other gases like argon , Krypton , neon , Co² etc. Carbon dioxide is only 0.04% in the atmosphere.</details><hr>
<details><summary>Lowest Layer of Atmosphere in which all weather systems are formed -</summary>
<b>Ans- Troposphere</b><br>Troposphere is the layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth's surface, reaching up to a height of about 10-15 km. It contains 75% of the total air of the atmosphere. The temperature and the pressure drops as one goes higher up the troposphere.</details><hr>
<details><summary>Layer which is important for global radio communication-</summary>
<b>Ans- Lonosphere</b><br>Lonosphere which is also known as Thermosphere. This layer contains electrically charged "ions" which help in transmitting radio waves back to earth. Satellites, which helps in transmitting signals back to earth are located here</details><hr>
<details><summary>In Thermosphere temperature reach to -</summary>
<b>Ans- 1200°C</b><br>In Thermosphere temperature can rech to 1200°C to even 1400°C</details><hr>
<details><summary>Layer of Atmosphere that contains Ozone Layer -</summary>
<b>Ans- Stratosphere</b><br>The Stratosphere contains a thin layer of Ozone Gas which absorbs most of the harmful Ultraviolet Radiation emitted from the Sun</details><hr>
<details><summary>Outermost Layer of Atmosphere -</summary>
<b>Ans- Exosphere</b><br>Exosphere is the outermost layer of the Atmosphere and extends up to 80km above the earth's surface to the outer space</details><hr>
<details><summary>In Troposphere, temperature decreases by 1°c for every ___ metres of ascent and this rate is known as _____.</summary>
<b>Ans- 166 , Lapse Rate</b><br></details><hr>
<details><summary>Atmosphere of Venus is mainly made up of </summary>
<b>Ans- Carbon Dioxide</b><br>carbon dioxide is the main gas for Greenhouse effect. That's why Venus is the hottest plaanet in the Solar System.</details><hr>
<details><summary>Which gas gives planets blue colour -</summary>
<b>Ans- Methane</b><br>Methane is the gas which gives planets blue colour. It's significantly present in Uranus and Neptune</details><hr>
<details><summary>Which is the most important gas for Greenhouse effect ?</summary>
<b>Ans- Carbon Dioxide</b><br>Carbon Dioxide traps the heat of the Sun and does not let all of it go back into space. This keeps the earth warm at night and is essential for germination of plants and survival of life. This process is known as the greenhouse effect.</details><hr>
